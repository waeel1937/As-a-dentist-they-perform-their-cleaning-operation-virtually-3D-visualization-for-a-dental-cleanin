 This repository contains the project submit of Erik Raschke and Wael Kheshfeh for the course "Augmented Reality/ Virtual Reality WiSe 22/23". The structure of the repository is as follows: The folder project contains the actual program. Inside of that there are subdirectories in tools with which a library is created for the Viewdentistry.sln  to be used. In the directory .txt files are located which can be used to work with the program. It is recommended to select this directory as the working directory. 
 
 
## How to use it


There are two options, how to use it. Either you download zip-package or you can clone this repository to your project directory. If you use the repository directly, you should be aware that the project generator uses relative paths, e.g. input and output paths. To familiarize yourself with the software, read our Project Paper. A good starting point is the "Background" guide. There are further sections describing the individual building blocks of the project generator.




## Abstract
The paper, titled "How Dentists Perform Their
dental cleaning work virtually: 3D visualization
tion for dental cleaning with Oculus Rift glasses
and display of Dicom image data," authored by
Mohamad Wael Kheshfeh and Erik Raschke, describes a technique for cleaning teeth with the
aid of virtual reality technology. The authorsâ€™
paper inspired a study of the potential advantages and practical applications of this method.
The results suggest that simulation of dental
procedures in a virtual environment can help
minimize errors in performing the procedures in
real life.


## Structure

The basic approach to performing an dental operation that would be done in real life by a dentist is to gradually achieve the goal while taking into account the accuracy and safety of the
patient. This is because it is often difficult to
predict the outcome of an operation that depends on the actions of both the dentist and
the patient. It would be much easier to first
test if the operation is likely to be successful
and show the patient what the final result will
look like. Therefore, our project Smile PNT focuses on various ways of performing steps and
using tools to achieve the goal with higher quality and comfort. At each step of the operation,
we pay attention to the measurements displayed
on the screen, with a focus on comfort. After
each step, the results are recorded, and various
target shapes are evaluated and compared to the
skull. If the error is small enough, the change is
accepted and the next step is taken. In order
to achieve the final target shape, all debris must
be removed and cleaned with water, resulting
in a final quality that is similar to perfect teeth
cleaning.
