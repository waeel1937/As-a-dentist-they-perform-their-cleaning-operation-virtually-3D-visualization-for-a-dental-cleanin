 This repository contains the project submit of Erik Raschke and Wael Kheshfeh for the course "Augmented Reality/ Virtual Reality WiSe 22/23". The structure of the repository is as follows: The folder project contains the actual program. Inside of that there are subdirectories in tools with which a library is created for the Viewdentistry.sln  to be used. In the directory .txt files are located which can be used to work with the program. It is recommended to select this directory as the working directory.
