This repository contains the project submission of Erik Raschke and Wael Kheshfeh for the course "Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality WiSe 22/23". The project involves creating a 3D virtual environment for visualizing and simulating dental cleaning procedures.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`project/`**: Contains the core program files.
  - **`tools/`**: Contains libraries required for the `ViewDentistry.sln` solution.
  - **`*.txt` files**: Configuration files that help set up the working environment for the program.
  
  It is recommended to set this directory as your working directory when working with the project.

## How to Use

There are two options for using the project:

1. **Download the Zip Package**: Download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your project directory.
   
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository directly to your project directory using Git. If you clone the repository, please note that the project uses relative paths for input and output.

To get started, refer to the **Project Paper** for detailed information on how the project works. We recommend beginning with the **Background** guide to understand the system's architecture. Additional sections explain the individual components of the project generator.
